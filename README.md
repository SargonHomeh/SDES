Simplified DES (SDES) implementation in Python for both encryption and decryption. Program requires the input of an 8-bit plaintext/ciphertext and a 10bit key both in binary format.

#Usage
    python SDES.py

    1: Encryption
    	10bit key
    	8bit plaintext
    2: Decryption
    	10bit key
    	8bit ciphertext
    3: Exit
